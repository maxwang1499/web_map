# NYC Building Emission Map

This is a map of the carbon emission and Local Law 97 compliance status of any building with gross square area over 25,000 ft^2 in NYC. In order to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality goal, NYC passed Local Law 97, which places building-specific carbon thresholds on any building with gross square footage over 25,000 ft^2 and charges a penalty for every unit of carbon that exceeds the threshold. The law comes into effect in 2024, with more stringent thresholds planned out in 2030. Together, those buildings make up more than 60% of NYC's carbon emission. The map is written using js, css, and html with the help of the Mapbox package. I created the map in the NYU Web-mapping class as the final project.
