This is a map of 100 dirtiest buildings in NYC based on carbon emission according to Local Law 84 disclosure. Just those 100 buildings account for 63% of the building emission in the LL84 disclosure. The map is written using js, css, and html with the help of the Mapbox package. We created the map in the NYU Web-mapping class for demonstration purposes.
