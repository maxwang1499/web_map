# NYC Building Emission Map

This is a map of the carbon emission and Local Law 97 compliance status of any building with gross square area over 25,000 ft^2 in NYC. In order to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality goal, NYC passed Local Law 97, which places building-specific carbon thresholds on any building with gross square footage over 25,000 ft^2 and changes a penalty for every unit of carbon that exceeds the threshold. The law kicks in 2024, with a more stringent threshold planned out in 2030. Together, those buildings make up more than 60% of NYC's carbon emission. The map is written using js, css, and html with the help of the Mapbox package. We created the map in the NYU Web-mapping class as the final project.
